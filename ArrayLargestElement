Given an array, arr. The task is to find the largest element in it.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]
Output: 90
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 90.
Input: arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 5.
Input: arr = [10]
Output: 10
Explanation: There is only one element which is the largest
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size()<= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
ANS:
class Solution {
    public static int largest(int n, int[] arr) {
        
    int Max = arr[0];
    
    for (int i=1;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]>Max){
            Max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return Max;
      
    }
}
